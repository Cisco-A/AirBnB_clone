The ALX-Holberton B&B encapsulates my four months of full-stack software engineering study at the ALX-Holberton School. The project's objective is to use my server to deploy a copy of the Airbnb website. The project's final version will include:

1. A shell-like command interpreter for command-line data manipulation (for development and debugging) 
2. A front-end website with both static and dynamic features 
3. An extensive database to control the backend features 
4. An API that acts as a conduit for communication between the system's front and back ends. 
5. Review of general ideas
